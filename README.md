### Thermal Armor
In order to protect yourself from freezing to death on the surface, you can craft variants of thermal armor. You must wear all pieces of thermal armor in order to not freeze. You can wear different types of thermal armor.

### Frost Resistance
Frost resistance is a status effect which prevents a player or mob from freezing to death. If a player dies and the apocalypse level is high enough, the player will get 2 minutes of frost resistance. This should give players enough time to get to a safe location.
